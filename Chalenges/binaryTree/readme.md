# Binary Tree
Make a binary tree.  

## Challenge
A lot of stuff

## Approach & Efficiency
I guessed but also avoided any nesting nothing should be worse than O(n log n).

# Breadth First
Go across layers instead of down and up.

## Challenge
It's way easier to just go down, because there are no pointers to the parent node.  Instead you have to bank the children in a queue in order to go backwards.  I made it work but I'm not sure how.

## Approach & Efficiency
This contains a nested loop it's really really bad actually. However I don't know how to fix it hahahaha.

# Find Largest Value 
Find the largest value in the tree and return it.

## Challenge
Reused a depth first function but instead of an array I used an object to store the value and then returned it.

## Approach & Efficiency
Pretty good?  Reused as much code as possible.
