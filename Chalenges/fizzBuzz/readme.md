# Fizz Buzz Tree
Make a binary tree and then travel though the tree and replace every value that is divisible with 3 or 5 with fizz or buzz or fizzbuzz. 

## Challenge
Refactoring code to walk through values changing them only when needed and not returning anything.

## Approach & Efficiency
Used exactly what I did for binary tree but modify as needed.
