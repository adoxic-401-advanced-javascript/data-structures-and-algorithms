# Bracket Validation
Stacks fallow a first in last out structure like a stack of plates.  Queues fallow a first in first out structure like waiting in line to get ice cream.

## Challenge
Make sure that both of these structures behave as expected and that you can add remove and create all structures. 

## Approach & Efficiency
I guessed but also avoided any nesting nothing should be worse than O(n log n).
