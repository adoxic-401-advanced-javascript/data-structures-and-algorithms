# Left Join
Take two hash tables and if they have the same key add the left value.

## Challenge
Make sure that if there is no key in the first array don't add from the second array. Only add when keys match
and if it exists in first array and not in the second add null.

## Approach & Efficiency
Nested ifs inside of a for loop so probably not awesome at lease O(n lon n)
